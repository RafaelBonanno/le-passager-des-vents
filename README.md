With the help of Le Wagon's boilerplate, I just created the Rails app for my dad's website named Le Passager Des Vents (music instruments repair shop in the south of France)

23-11-12 : Its almost christmas but it's also time for me to work. I focused on creating a rather simple but efficient navbar for the website - as it's mainly going to be a "display" website, I do not look into making it too complicated, but more efficient and focused around my dad's needs.
Hence I developed this navbar - huge wip but it's a start :)
